### Use case 1
Use case: Rx fill behavior data including 1st, 2nd, 3rd fill and persistency / Length Of 
Therapy available in a dashboard for multiple countries.
- Business problem: Dashboard by default has few trend views and summary highlights by 
country. Market and data maturity context also available. Want to have a GenAI / 
Agentic AI implementation that will allow end users / leaders to interact and get insights
they need in addition to default dashboard views. 
- Objective: The AI interaction should produce accurate relevant insights based on what 
country, data maturity and any market context and the Rx behavior dataset. For this use 
case - thru this training we should be able to apply what is being taught and understand 
the following: 

1. Data readiness - considerations, format etc.<br>
2. Prompt engineering <br>
3. Training the model <br>
4. Limitations<br>
